## Koans Assignment

Project 2 - Koans

A koan is a “teaching question” that is used in Buddhist discourse that seeks to provide deep insight into a problem. While the answer to a koan can be subtle, they are not meant to be tricky like a puzzle is. Koans have correct answers, but the intention of working through a koan is to understand its deeper meaning. To gain a better understanding of the Java programming language, you will work through a series of Java koans during the first half of this course. Each koan is a small piece of code (about the size of a unit test) that demonstrates a particular feature or aspect of the Java language or API. The koans were originally authored by Mat Bentley and can found in their original form at https://github.com/matyb/java-koans

Similar to project1, you need to clone a copy to your own repository by clicking on this link:
https://classroom.github.com/a/_xUprayY

Once you clone your repository, you will be able to look at the readme of your repository under java-koans folder. 

There 3 steps in this process:
Develop and solve each koan:
	You need to import your project into an IDE (i.e. intellij) and start developing from beginner to intermediate and then advanced problems. 
Test your work:
Open a terminal and go to the directory in which the koans dir is located. Now execute run.bat for windows and run.sh for OSx and Linux.
      3. Every time you solve a problem set you will commit your work to your github account.
